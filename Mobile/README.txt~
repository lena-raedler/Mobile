This Project was created by:

Sabrina Schmitzer

It requires libGLEW.so.1.13.

For the thrid programming assingment we decided to delete the automatic camera mode.

The second light source is sitting directly on each of the Models and moves around with it.

Our keyboard functions:

the normal mode which is activated when pressing 1
	here you can:
	stop (p), change direction (s), go back to normal (o)
	speed up (+), slow down (-) and
	quit (q)

and the full user control mode which is activated when pressing 2
	here you can:
	zoom in (8), zoom out (5), translate camera left (4), translate camera right (6),
	reset to normal (o), quit (q), change Hue (h), change value (v),
	turn off ambient light (a), turn off diffuse light (d), turn off specular light (s)
	here you also can use the mouse:
	left button - speed up
	right button - slow down
	middle button- change direction

To run the project use make and ./Mobile_Shader
